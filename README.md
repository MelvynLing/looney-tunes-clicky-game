## Objective:
The objective of this game is to test user's memory, seeing how long they can last before clicking on the same character. The theme of the game is Looney Toons.

## Overview:
This is a react app, it uses the React javascript framework to dynamically render the characters every time a character is clicked or if the page is reloaded. When the user clicks on an image that they have already clicked on they are prompted that they have lost and a new game begins. 


## Instructions:

[]
* When the page loads, a new game begins. the user is to click on a character.
[]
* Once clicked, the characters switch spots to a new location.
* At this point, the user is to click on a new character. 
* If the users selects a character or image that they have already selected before then they loose the game. the score resets to 0 and they can play again.
